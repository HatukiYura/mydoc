This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to Web3, the next evolution of the internet. We will trace the progression from the early read-only internet (Web1) to the social, participatory platforms of Web2, and finally to the emerging decentralized and user-controlled vision of Web3.

This subsection **delves into** the initial days of Web1, examining its design, functionality, and limitations.

It democratized access to information, enabling anyone with an internet connection to access a wealth of knowledge from anywhere in the world.



Security was another concern with web1.

As the internet began to grow, so did the risks associated with data privacy and security.

However, the security protocols and infrastructure necessary to protect user data were only partially developed durig the web1 era.

This led to various security challenges, some of which persist to this day.



Web3 also brings with it the potential for more economic inclusivity.



However, the transition to web3 is not without its challenges.

Technical conplexity, scalability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and public understanding are all **hurdles** that need to be overcome.

Furthemore,  **while** the promise of decentralization is appealing, it also raises new questions about governance, accountability, and security that are **yet** to be fully addressed.



In web3, the concept of a trustless system comes to the fore, with cryptographic guarantees replacing the need for intermediaries.

the practice or policy of providing equal access to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized, such as those having physical or intellectual disabilities or belonging to other minority.为那些可能被排除在外或处于边缘地位的人（如身体或智力有残疾的人或属于其他少数群体的人）提供平等机会和资源的做法或政策。

Yet, the transition to web3 is not straightforward and is fraught with challenges.

These are all barriers that need to be surmounted.这些都是需要克服的障碍。

As we venture further into the web3 era, it is worth **pondering on** some thought-provoking ideas.



As we contemplate these questions, we begin to realize that the emergence of web3 is not just a technological shift, but also a profound social and economic transformation.

**The journey to web3 offers an opportunity to reshape the digital world, a chance to build an internet that truly puts users first.**
